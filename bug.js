This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  Specifically, if the app is already open and a deep link is clicked, the `Linking.addEventListener` doesn't always trigger the callback function. This results in the app not responding to the subsequent navigation action expected through the deep link. The inconsistency seems to be related to the timing of the `Linking.addEventListener` setup and the arrival of the deep link intent.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, which makes debugging extremely difficult.
